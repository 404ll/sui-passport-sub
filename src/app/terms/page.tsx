            <p>Please read these Terms of Service (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”) and
                our Privacy Policy carefully because they govern your use of the

                (“<strong>Sui Foundation</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,”
                “<strong>our</strong>”). To make these Terms easier to read, the Site
                and our services (including Beta Services) are collectively called the
                “<strong>Interface.</strong>” The Interface may facilitate interaction
                with the Sui decentralized cryptographic protocols, maintained by third
                party open source communities, which we do not own or control (the
                “<strong>Protocol</strong>”) allowing for activities such as the
                creation of non-fungible tokens (“<strong>NFTs</strong>”), blockchain
                games, DeFi apps, marketplaces, automated market makers, and
                wallets.</p>
            <p><strong>BY USING THESE SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE NOT A

            <p>WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED
                EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND SUI FOUNDATION THROUGH
                BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW
                CAREFULLY SECTION 16 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING
                ARBITRATION. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION WHERE
                APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, THE AGREEMENT TO
                ARBITRATE IN SECTION 16 WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU, BUT THE PROVISIONS OF
                SECTION 15 (GOVERNING LAW) WILL APPLY INSTEAD.</p>

            <p>By using our Interface, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you
                don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Interface.</p>
            <h1 id="privacy-policy"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
            <p>Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the

            <p>We may update the Terms, including any addendum terms, from time to
                time in our sole discretion. If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the
                updated Terms on the Site and/or may also send other communications.
                It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you
                use the Interface. If you continue to use the Interface after we have
                posted updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes.
                If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the
                Interface anymore. Because our Interface is evolving over time we may
                change or discontinue all or any part of the Interface, at any time and
                without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
